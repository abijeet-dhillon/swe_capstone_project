## 1. Project Scope and Usage Scenario
Creators (graduating students or early professionals) want a privacy-first way to scan selected folders on their own machines to mine digital work artifacts (code repositories, documents, slides, and media/design files) and produce highlights and portfolio summaries; Administrators (the local machine owner, often the same person) configure and consent to scanning policies such as allowlists/denylists and redaction, while Reviewers (instructors, mentors, hiring managers) never access raw files but consume exported summaries (JSON/CSV/PDF) produced by the system. The typical flow is that a Creator configures a scan, the system parses and normalizes artifact metadata locally, computes insights such as contribution timelines and document activity, stores them locally, and then the Creator exports a concise report for Reviewers.

## 2. Proposed Solution
We will implement a local-first pipeline with three components: (1) a Scanner that enumerates files from user-approved folders and detects types; (2) Adapters for key artifact classes (Git repositories via GitPython/pydriller; Office/PDF via `python-docx`/`python-pptx`/`pdfminer`; basic media/design metadata via `ffprobe` or equivalent); and (3) a FastAPI service that exposes REST endpoints for artifacts and insights. Processing and storage remain local by default to protect privacy, and the API will be consumed by a dashboard in Term 2.

Our value proposition is a privacy-first, testable, and extensible architecture that surfaces meaningful signals (commit velocity, project timelines, document activity) in a deterministic way; compared to other teams, we emphasize: (a) a plug-in adapter interface that makes file-type support straightforward to extend, (b) robust PII redaction before storage, and (c) a full requirements→tests traceability matrix to ensure verifiability from the outset.

## 3. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Configure Scan
- **Primary actor:** Creator  
- **Description:** Select folders to scan and set scanning/redaction preferences.  
- **Precondition:** Application installed locally; Creator has access to target folders.  
- **Postcondition:** A scan configuration with allowlists/denylists, size caps, and redaction rules is saved.  
- **Main Scenario:**
  1. Creator opens app and chooses “Configure Scan.”
  2. Creator selects one or more folders (e.g., `./Projects`, external drive).
  3. Creator sets file-type limits, max file size, and exclusion patterns.
  4. Creator reviews default redaction rules and adjusts as needed.
  5. System validates access and saves configuration.
- **Extensions:**
  - Folder not accessible: system displays error and suggests alternatives.
  - Conflicting rules: system highlights conflicts and asks for resolution.

### Use Case 2: Run Scan & Ingest
- **Primary actor:** Creator  
- **Description:** Enumerate files, parse artifacts via adapters, normalize and deduplicate, apply redaction, and persist locally.  
- **Precondition:** A valid scan configuration exists.  
- **Postcondition:** Normalized artifacts and derived metrics are stored in the local DB with an audit log.  
- **Main Scenario:**
  1. Creator clicks “Run Scan.”
  2. System enumerates files and detects types.
  3. Adapters extract metadata/content summaries (Git stats, doc word/page counts, media duration).
  4. System normalizes, deduplicates by hash, and applies redaction.
  5. System writes records to DB and emits progress status.
- **Extensions:**
  - Timeout on large files: system skips with warning and continues.
  - Duplicate files detected: single canonical record retained.

### Use Case 3: View Insights via API
- **Primary actor:** Creator  
- **Description:** Query local API for artifacts, timelines, and summary insights.  
- **Precondition:** Scan has completed successfully.  
- **Postcondition:** Creator receives JSON responses for artifacts and insights.  
- **Main Scenario:**
  1. Creator requests summary endpoint (e.g., `/insights/summary`).
  2. System aggregates metrics (contribution heatmap, streaks).
  3. System returns JSON with totals and timelines.
- **Extensions:**
  - Empty dataset: system returns empty arrays with guidance to run a scan.

### Use Case 4: Export Summaries
- **Primary actor:** Creator  
- **Description:** Export selected insights as JSON/CSV/PDF for Reviewers.  
- **Precondition:** Insights exist in the DB.  
- **Postcondition:** Exported file is generated locally.  
- **Main Scenario:**
  1. Creator selects export format and scope (time window/projects).
  2. System formats and writes the export to a chosen location.
  3. System confirms completion and path to file.
- **Extensions:**
  - Path not writable: system prompts for another/default location.

### Use Case 5: Manage Privacy/Redaction
- **Primary actor:** Administrator  
- **Description:** Configure redaction policies and retention; purge data on request.  
- **Precondition:** Admin access to the local instance.  
- **Postcondition:** Policies are updated; data purged if requested.  
- **Main Scenario:**
  1. Admin opens Privacy settings.
  2. Admin edits redaction regexes and retention windows.
  3. System revalidates rules and saves.
- **Extensions:**
  - Invalid regex: system highlights error and suggests a fix.



### Use Case 6: Add Notes/Annotations

- **Primary actor:** Creator  
- **Description:** Attach personal notes or reflections to a project or artifact.  
- **Precondition:** Artifact exists in the local database.  
- **Postcondition:** Note is stored and associated with the artifact.  

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Creator selects an artifact from the list of scanned items.  
2. Creator chooses “Add Note.”  
3. Creator writes a note and saves it.  
4. System stores the note linked to the artifact.  
5. System confirms successful save.  

**Extensions:**  
- Empty note submitted → system rejects and prompts for valid input.  
- Artifact deleted before save → system displays error and cancels operation.

### Use Case 7: Reviewer Consumes Export

- **Primary actor:** Reviewer  
- **Description:** Reviewer opens and reviews an exported portfolio summary without accessing raw files.  
- **Precondition:** Export file (JSON/CSV/PDF) has been generated by the Creator.  
- **Postcondition:** Reviewer is able to view structured insights and summaries.  

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Reviewer receives the exported file from the Creator.  
2. Reviewer opens the file in a suitable application (e.g., Excel for CSV, PDF reader).  
3. Reviewer reviews contributions, timelines, and summaries.  

**Extensions:**  
- Export file is missing or corrupted → Reviewer cannot open and requests Creator to regenerate.  
- Reviewer requests more detail → Creator reconfigures export and generates a new file.
